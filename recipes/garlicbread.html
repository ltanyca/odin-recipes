  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A very easy recipe for garlic bread that is made with 
    roasted garlic, butter and Parmesan cheese.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 heads garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread</li>
    <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the tops 
        off of garlic heads so the tip of each clove is exposed. Place garlic 
        on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake until garlic is soft, 
        about 30 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the oven to broil. Slice the loaf of bread in half horizontally, 
        and place cut-side up on a baking sheet. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Squeeze the cloves of garlic from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir 
        in the butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese until well blended. Spread 
        onto the cut sides of the bread.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes. 
    </li>
